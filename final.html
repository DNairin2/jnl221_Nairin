			<h3>States to have the most shootings over the last 40 years</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<img src="syr.png" alt="an image of a photograph, of Syracuse University" height="150px" width="200px">
			<p>This study clearly shows that over this time period, California has had the most mass shootings with Florida and Texas being a close 2nd and 3rd. From looking at this, it can be assumed that large states with big populations are more likely to have more mass shootings.</p>

			<h3>Should we expect more mass shootings in the future based on the study</h3>
			<p>From this study, it is shown that the largest jump between decades occurred between the 2000s and 2010s with there being over 3 times as many occurances in the 2010s. Considering there have already been almost half the amount of mass shootings in the 2020s as there were in the 2010s, it would be reasonable to assume that this rate will exceed the previous rate, as it is only 2023.</p>

			<h3>Mental Health Signs among Suspects</h3>
			<p>Mental health is a huge problem in America, and some people do not take it as seriosuly as it should be taken. This study shows that of the 147 cases, only 17 of them had a suspect that did not have prior signs of mental health problems. 71 did have prior signs and the rest were unknown. This is pretty clear that mental health needs to be treated as a problem because it is a trend in these crimes, and taking it seriously could be a way of preventing more in the future.</p>
