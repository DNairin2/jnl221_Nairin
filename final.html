			<h2>Is there a true connection between Mass Shootings and Mental Health Related Issues?</h2>
			<h4> Mother Jones Magazine conducted a study where they took some of the biggest mass shootings in America in the last 50 years<br>By Dylan Nairin</h4>

			<p>Gun Violence is a huge problem in America, as the number of deaths seems to increase everywhere we look. These crimes are happening at all sorts of places, including schools, stores, and religious places, just to name a few. The biggest problem is that not many people are doing anything to try and limit gun violence here. Because of this, we see more and more shootings all the time. More times than not, when watching a newscast, there will be a story about a shooting that occured in the area. I had the priviledge to interview Marc Brown, who is a newscaster at KABC-TV in Los Angeles, California about how he has noticed covering mass shootings has changed over the years. In the interview, he said that there has been a steady increase in the frequency of these events, and with that, there has been an increase in news coverage on the subject. He said that the coverage of the events has shifted now. Brown said, "The coverage now includes questions about the availability and lethality  of the weapons used, and we are now asking policy makers whether there are ways to keep these shootings from happening." There whole goal now is to try and hold policy makers accountable now, so the need for change is shown clearly. These shootings are a major issue in heavily populated places throughout the country. In this particular study by Mother Jones Magazine, large states such as California, Texas, and Florida seem to have more shootings than other states. This is not a new problem that just popped up out of nowhere. Mass shootings have been taking place throughout history, but in America, the numbers have skyrocketed.
			<p>An issue that has also been emerging as a major problem in America is mental health problems. Mental health illnesses have a huge impact on some people, and it can make them feel many different things that they may not know how to control. Being in this state of mind makes people do harmful things to themselves and others. Mass shootings are examples of one of these harmful things that can happen as a result of mental illnesses if they are neglected by people around them. Resources have been created to help, but more people need to be educated on this topic so they care to help more. This could help limit the amount of harm in America. </p>

			<h3>States to have the most shootings over the last 50 years</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>This graph above only shows the 3 states that had the most mass shootings over the 50 years. This study clearly shows that over this time period, California has had the most mass shootings with Florida and Texas being a close 2nd and 3rd. From looking at this, it can be assumed that large states with big populations are more likely to have more mass shootings. These particular states have many people to control and a huge area of land, which is what makes them more vulnerable. It is much harder to control people when there are so many of them and they are so far apart. Ways that these problems can be resolved to an extent could include more people holding others accountable and stricter legislation towards acquiring guns.</p>
			<p>I also talked to Marc Brown about his opinion for how large states could help prevent these shootings based on strategies he has seen in his years of covering news stories. In the interview, Brown said that something he has noticed people bringing up in coversations regarding gun control are "Red Flag" laws. According to Brown, these laws would, "allow police to confiscate weapons from people who indicate they are unstable and might commit violence, would help a lot." This takes into account mental health problems and is a good way to get people help and stop them from making a decision that will negatively harm themselves and others. Another part of these Red Flag laws would ban the use of assault weapons, which are the most common weapon of choice in these mass shootings. Brown pointed out that there has been a steadily increasing trend of mass shootings since the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Red Flag laws could be a huge step towards progress if they are actually implemented in these large states, as they will stop people from having access to assault weapons and also make sure people who are mentally stable are the only ones who can get these weapons.</p>

			<h3>Should we expect more mass shootings in these US states in the future based on the study</h3>
			<p>This graph at the top of the page shows that California has already had 6 mass shootings studied in the 2020s compared to 13 in the 2010s. There have been almost half as many in not evn 3 years this decade. Texas has had only 1 mass shooting accoridng to this study in the 2020s compared to having 7 in the 2010s. According to the Mother Jones Study, Florida has already hit a third of the amount of shootings in the 2010s so far in this decade. There is still a lot of time in the 2020s, and these large states have already had problems.</p>
			<p>These 3 states are 3 of the largest and most populated states in America, so it is no surprise that they have seen the most mass shootings. In particular, California has seen the biggest increase in these events. It is not only the large states that are having these problems. The US as a total has already had almost half the amount of mass shootings in the 2020s as there were in the 2010s, so it would be reasonable to assume that this rate will exceed the previous rate, as it is only 2023. If the US wants to save lives, they need to make changes quickly or else the number of shootings is just going to keep skyrocketing for the foreseeable future.</p>

			<h3>Mental Health Signs among Suspects</h3>
			<p>Mental health is a huge problem in America, and some people do not take it as seriosuly as it should be taken. This study shows that of the 147 cases, only 17 of them had a suspect that did not have prior signs of mental health problems. 71 did have prior signs and the rest were unknown. This is pretty clear that mental health needs to be treated as a problem because it is a trend in these crimes, and taking it seriously could be a way of preventing more in the future.</p>
			<iframe title="Are Mental Health Problems Associated with Mass Shootings" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-xWArK" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xWArK/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="234" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

			<p>In this article from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/nyregion/before-newtown-shootings-adam-lanzas-mental-problems-completely-untreated-report-says.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> about the suspect of the Sandy Hook mass shooting in 2012, it tells the story of a study which recorded that medical experts at Yale University called for the treatment of mental health illnesses of the suspect, but that the treatment was never actually administered. According to the study, Adam Lanza, who was the suspect, "was “completely untreated in the years before the shooting” for psychiatric and physical ailments like anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and was also deprived of recommended services and drugs". The report also added that his undiagnosed anorexia could have negatively affected his mental health state. Multiple people had recommended treatment methods for Lanza, but he never actually ended up receiving any treatment and his weapon was never taken away from him despite being in this dangerous mental state. Dr. Harold Schwartz, chief psychiatrist at Hartford Hospital’s Institute of Living, said at a news conference, "It’s not that his mental illness was a predisposing factor in this tragedy. It was his untreated mental illness that was a predisposing factor." His parents never actually sought out the help that he needed, which this article points out was one of the huge reasons for why this shooting happened and over 20 people were killed, including him and his mother.</p>
			<p>Mental health issues are very important and when they go untreated, that is when problems tend to arise. If the parents got their son the help they were reccomended for him, who knows what would happen in this situation. If he was in a better mental state, this shooting may not have happened and these lives could have been saved. Sandy Hook is a huge reason why mental health issues need to be taken seriously since it is a huge problem in America and leads to many people making unrational decisions, including committing these acts of terror. </p>
